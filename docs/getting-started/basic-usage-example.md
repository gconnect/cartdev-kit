Replace mydapp with the desired name of your project. This command will prompt you to select a template and configure the project settings.

### CLI Options:

View available command-line options and flags by running

```
cartdevkit --help
```

### Backend Setup

To setup your backend here are the required steps:

* Navigate to the backend directory of your created project and run the below command, keep in mind also ensure your [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is all setup up and running.
* Install all required dependencies using either `yarn install` or `npm i`

### !NOTE

To build and run the backend ensure that you have [Cartesi CLI](https://docs.sunodo.io/guide/introduction/installing) is installed and your docker is up and running. For debugging purpose, you can run cartesi doctor.

*   Build the project by running the below command;

    ```
      cartesi build
    ```

This will help build the image and run the Cartesi machine. Once this step is completed you should see something like this

The next step will be to start the local backend server by running

```
  cartesi run
```

If all goes well you should see this

### Debugging

For quick troubleshooting incase you run into any issue you can quickly check the status using

```
cartesi doctor
```

This will start the development server

### Frontend Setup

If you are working on the frontend, here are the required steps:

* Navigate into the frontend project directory
* Install all required dependencies using either `npm i` or `yarn install`

#### !NOTE

Once you generate the frontend template, ensure to create a `.env` file and provide your project Id as it's an important requirement when working with Rainbowkit and Wagmi.

Your `.env` file should look like this ðŸ‘‡ on the nextjs template

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLECT_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID= YOUR PROJECT ID
```

If using the react-app template your `.env` file should look like this ðŸ‘‡ on the nextjs template

```
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID= YOUR PROJECT ID
```

* Start up the local server using the below command.

```
npm run dev 
```

### !Note

A detailed setup guide can be found in the readme of the individual selected template.
