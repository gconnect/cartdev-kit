The architecture of CartDevKit consists of several key components that work together to fulfill its functionality and provide a seamless user experience.

### **Components**

* **CLI Interface:** The user-facing command-line interface for interacting with the tool and executing commands.
* **Template Engine:** Responsible for processing user inputs, retrieving templates, and generating project files based on selected templates.
* **Template Repositories:** Repositories containing predefined templates for various technologies and frameworks, accessible by the template engine.
* **Configuration Management:** Handles user configurations and project settings, allowing users to customize their project setups.

### **Flow**

The flow of data and interactions within the architecture begins with user inputs provided via the CLI interface. These inputs are processed by the template engine, which retrieves the necessary templates from the template repositories. The template engine then generates project files based on the selected templates and user configurations, creating a fully scaffolded project structure.

### **Scalability and Extensibility**

CartDevKit is designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing for future enhancements and the addition of new features. Its modular architecture enables easy integration of new templates, features, ensuring that the tool can evolve and adapt to the changing needs of developers.
