# Problems and Solutions

### **Problem**

* New developers to the Cartesi platform usually find it difficult to get started building.
* **Time-consuming Project Setup:** Setting up a new project often involves manual configuration and setup, which can be time-consuming and tedious.
* **Scattered Resources:** Tool many resources in different places can be confusing and tiring for developers
* **Lack of Standardized Project Structures:** Different technologies and frameworks have different project structures, leading to inconsistencies across projects.
* **Integration Complexity:** Integrating multiple technologies and frameworks in a single project can be complex and error-prone.
* **Boilerplate Code Repetition:** Developers often find themselves writing repetitive boilerplate code for common project components.
* **Inconsistencies Across Projects:** Inconsistent project structures and configurations make it difficult to maintain and collaborate on projects.

### **Solution**

* **Streamlined Project Setup:** CartesiKit provides easy-to-use templates for generating project structures, reducing the time and effort required to set up new projects.
* **Standardized Project Structures:** Predefined templates ensure consistent project structures across different technologies and frameworks.
* **Simplified Integration:** Templates include configurations and integrations for common technologies and frameworks, simplifying the integration process.
* **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** CartesiKit generates starter code for common project components, eliminating the need for developers to write repetitive boilerplate code.
* **Enhanced Consistency:** By providing standardized templates and configurations, CartesiKit ensures consistency and uniformity across projects.
